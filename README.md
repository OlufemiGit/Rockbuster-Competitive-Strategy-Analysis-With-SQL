# **Project Summary**
Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a former global movie rental company, is strategizing to compete with modern streaming services by launching an online video rental platform. This project leverages SQL to analyze Rockbuster's existing data, providing insights to inform business decisions for this transition.

# **Objective**
The primary goal is to extract, analyze, and visualize key business insights using SQL to support Rockbuster’s management in making data-driven decisions. The findings will help optimize revenue streams, customer engagement, and geographical targeting for the new service.

# **Key Business & Analytical Questions Addressed**
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What is the average rental duration for all videos?
- Where are Rockbuster customers located?
- Where are high-lifetime-value customers based?
- Do sales figures vary across geographic regions?

# **Datasets Used**
The project utilizes Rockbuster’s internal data, including:
- **Film Inventory:** Titles, genres, rental duration
- **Customer Data:** Demographics, geographic distribution
- **Payment Transactions:** Rental payments, revenue insights

# **Tools & Technologies Used**
- **SQL:** Querying and data analysis
- **PostgreSQL:** Relational database management system
- **Excel:** Data visualization and reporting

# **Process / Methodology**
- **Data Loading:** Import Rockbuster’s dataset into PostgreSQL.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand relationships between tables.
- **SQL Queries:** Perform ad-hoc queries to extract key insights.
- **Data Cleaning & Filtering:** Handle missing values and inconsistent formats.
- **Visualization & Reporting:** Present insights in an intuitive format for business managers.
- **Final Presentation:** Compile results into a structured report with recommendations.

# **Disclaimer & Resources**

# **Resources:**
- **PostgreSQL** – The database management system used to store, query, and analyze structured data.
- **pgAdmin 4** – A graphical user interface (GUI) tool for managing PostgreSQL, creating databases, writing SQL queries, and visualizing results.
- **Excel** – While not an SQL tool, Excel can be useful for storing and comparing structured datasets before transitioning to an SQL database.

# **Installation Steps:**
- **Downloading & Installing PostgreSQL** from PostgreSQL’s official site
- **Setting up pgAdmin 4** for managing databases
- **Loading the Rockbuster Dataset** via database restore functionality
- **Using SQL Queries in pgAdmin 4’s Query Editor**
